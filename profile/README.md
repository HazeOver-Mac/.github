## Overview  

**HazeOver for Mac** is a lightweight and intuitive productivity tool designed to help you stay focused by dimming background windows automatically. Whether you’re working on documents, coding, or browsing the web, HazeOver enhances your concentration by gently highlighting the active app and fading out the distractions around it.  

The app integrates perfectly into macOS, maintaining the elegant design aesthetic that Mac users love. Once installed, HazeOver instantly starts managing window brightness dynamically—bringing the front window into focus while keeping everything else subtly darkened. This approach reduces eye strain, enhances visibility, and helps you work more efficiently, especially in multitasking environments.  

Unlike traditional productivity tools that require complex setup, **HazeOver** works quietly in the background. You can easily adjust the dimming intensity, change activation rules, and toggle the effect using keyboard shortcuts or the menu bar icon. It’s ideal for writers, developers, designers, and anyone who values a clear digital workspace.  

**HazeOver** also supports multi-monitor setups, ensuring consistent focus across screens. With Apple Silicon optimization, it delivers smooth performance without consuming system resources. It’s a small app that makes a big difference in how you interact with your Mac — creating a calm, distraction-free atmosphere for better focus and comfort.
